# Rachid-s-B-Plus-Tree-Project

Rachid’s B+Tree Project README

About: This project was one of four main projects that was assigned to me in my advanced programming class while I was attending Georgetown University. This project consisted on implementing an insertion-only B+Tree and testing its correctness using Junit testing. After the course ended, I decided to revisit the project to see where I could improve on it. For example, I made the B+Tree generic using Java generics, I implemented the removal procedure, and used Junit testing much more extensively than I did in my first implementation of the project. The project’s original creator is Wenchao Zhou, a professor in the Computer Science department at Georgetown University.

Source Code Use: The source code associated with this project is free for anyone to use. If one has found any bugs or has any suggestions/questions relating to the source code, please comment on the project page or email me at rachidtelfort@gmail.com.

Final Notes: I hope that my fellow coders will find the source code helpful as well as gain valuable insight from it. If you have read this, thank you for looking at my GitHub page it is much appreciated.
